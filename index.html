                <h1>Introducing crossbanc</h1>
                <p> Singapore, 9 August 2023.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p> In the 4Q of 2022, work on crossbanc, a financial information services application began with some responsibilities in mind.</p> 
                <br><br>

                <u>Providing access</u>
                <br><br>
                <p>“ Democratized finance requires that some people make reasoned judgements on the behalf of others yet in the view of utopians, democratizing finance = access + decentralization. ”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Soon, crossbanc will be available on your mobile phone, allowing you to easily search for what can theoretically be known as market anomalies.
                    <br>The outcome of a reasoned judgement can be whether you agree with the utopians and (or) take advantage of such opportunities.</p>    
                <!-- CTA -->
                <p>This is one example of how crossbanc provides you with access. Details are in the application.</p>
                <br><br>
                
                <u>Reducing our carbon footprint</u> 
                <br><br>
                <p>" Turning on a computer, driving a car, charging a mobile phone and other things we do at home and at work contributes to global warming more than any other. "</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Finance is like a language, its words are the same although each of us can communicate it differently or be at odds with others when using it.</p>
                <!-- CTA -->
                <p>Read it easily on crossbanc. crossbanc provides with speed the same words and more across asset classes.</p> 
                <br><br>
                
                <u>Factually relevant</u> 
                <br><br>
                <p>" crossbanc is an attempt to align both responsibilities. It can only avoid debate on its economic value by staying factually relevant. "</p>
                <br>
                <p>Regardless of whether an investment is for the immediate, short, or long term, a trade in the secondary market is typically the starting point.
                    <br>Finding new and equal ways to help you and I understand and be able to recognize what is happening each day without each of us unnecessarily repeating the same process is a critical challenge of our time.</p>
                <!-- CTA -->
                <p>You can download the application from the various App Stores when available.</p>
