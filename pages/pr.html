                    <p><!-- Introduction -->
                    In the fourth quarter of 2022, work on crossbanc, an application that effectively conveys information on financial instruments, began with these responsibilities in mind.

                    crossbanc will first be demonstrated on the mobile phone, allowing one to easily search for what can theoretically be known as market anomalies.</p>
                    <p>
                    The outcome of a reasoned judgement can be whether one agrees with the utopians and (or) take advantage of such opportunities.</p>
