# Introducing crossbanc
Singapore, 9 August 2023.
</br>

In the 4Q of 2022, work on crossbanc, a financial information services application began with some responsibilities in mind.
</br>
</br>
</br>

Providing access
</br>
<p>
“ Democratized finance requires that some people make reasoned judgements on the behalf of others [yet in the view] of today’s utopians, 
democratizing finance = access + decentralization. ”

Soon, crossbanc will be available on your mobile phone, allowing you to easily search for what can theoretically be known as market anomalies. 
The outcome of a reasoned judgement can be whether you agree with the utopians or take advantage of such opportunities. 

If successful, this is one example of how crossbanc provides you with access.

<p>
Reducing our carbon footprint
</br>
" Turning on a computer, driving a car, charging a mobile phone and other things we do at home and at work contributes to global warming more than any other " 
Finance is a language, its words are the same although each of us can communicate it differently or be at odds with others when using it. 

crossbanc provides with speed the same words and more across asset classes. 
</br>
</br>
Read it easily on crossbanc.

</br>
<p>
Factually relevant
</br>
crossbanc is an attempt to align both responsibilities globally. The journey will be challenging and the outcome is uncertain. 
It can only avoid debate on its economic value by staying factually relevant.
&nbsp;
Regardless of whether an investment is for the immediate, short, or long term, a trade in the secondary market is typically the starting point.
Finding new and equal ways to help you and I recognize opportunities is a critical challenge of our time.

Do download the application from the various App Stores when available.
