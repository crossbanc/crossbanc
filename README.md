<p>
In the 4Q of 2022, work on crossbanc, a financial information services application began with some responsibilities in mind.
</p>
</br></br>
<ins>Providing access</ins>
</br></br>
<p>
“ Democratized finance requires that some people make reasoned judgements on the behalf of others yet in the view of today’s utopians, democratizing finance = access + decentralization. ”
</br>
</br>
Soon, crossbanc will be available on your mobile phone, allowing you to easily search for what can theoretically be known as market anomalies. 
</br>
The outcome of a reasoned judgement can be whether you agree with the utopians and (or) take advantage of such opportunities. 
</br>
</br>
This is one example of how crossbanc provides you with access.
</p>
</br></br>
<ins>Reducing our carbon footprint</ins>
</br>
</br>
<p>
" Turning on a computer, driving a car, charging a mobile phone and other things we do at home and at work contributes to global warming more than any other. " 
</br>
</br>
Finance is a language, its words are the same although each of us can communicate it differently or be at odds with others when using it. 
</br>
</br>
crossbanc provides with speed the same words and more across asset classes. 
</br>
Read it easily on crossbanc.
</p>
</br></br>
<ins>Factually relevant</ins>
</br>
</br>
<p>
" crossbanc is an attempt to align both responsibilities. The journey will be challenging and the outcome is uncertain. 
</br>
It can only avoid debate on its economic value by staying factually relevant. "
</br>
</br>
Regardless of whether an investment is for the immediate, short, or long term, a trade in the secondary market is typically the starting point.
</br>
Finding new and equal ways to help you and I understand and be able to recongise what is happening each day is a critical challenge of our time. 
</br>
</br>
You can download the application from the various App Stores when available.
